Dynamic Few-shot prompting is an intuitive alternative to finetuning LLMs where:

- rapid iteration
- takes effect right away
- easy to implement

In Dynamic Few-shot prompting, instead of putting a static list of examples in the prompt, we dynamically pull the best examples from our database based on the user query.
